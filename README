# DSRemote
Operate your Rigol oscilloscope from your Linux desktop.
========================================================

webpage and info: https://www.teuniz.net/DSRemote/


Compiling and installing on Ubuntu Linux and derivatives:
---------------------------------------------------------

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++ make git qtbase5-dev-tools qtbase5-dev qt5-default
git clone https://gitlab.com/Teuniz/DSRemote.git
cd DSRemote
qmake
make -j4
sudo make install
dsremote


For USB connection setup use the following commands:
----------------------------------------------------

sudo groupadd usbtmc
sudo usermod -a -G usbtmc <username>
reboot

Now you can run the program by typing: dsremote

(USB connection does not work on modern USB host controllers thanks to
a bug in the scopes' firmware that Rigol does not want to fix.)

 Read also the file readme_usbtcm_driver.txt
 and the file notes.txt.
